Off chain indexer for the ICON Blockchain serving the **transactions** context of the [icon-explorer](https://github.com/geometry-labs/icon-explorer). Service is broken up into API and worker components that are run as individual docker containers. It depends on data coming in from [icon-etl](https://github.com/geometry-labs/icon-etl) over a Kafka message queue with persistence on a MongoDB database. 

### Endpoints 

TODO: Links and table 

### Deployment 

Service can be run in the following ways:

1. Independently from this repo with docker compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml -f docker-compose.yml up -d
# Or alternatively 
make up 
```   

2. With the whole stack from the main [icon-explorer](https://github.com/geometry-labs/icon-explorer) repo. 

3. With the helm chart.

**Please note this is for advanced users who are capable of setting external DBs / Strimzi and configuring them properly.**

TODO: 

```bash
helm add 
helm install 
```

Run `make help` for more options. 

### Development 

For local development, you will want to run the `docker-compose.db.yml` as you develop. To run the tests, 

```bash
make test 
```
